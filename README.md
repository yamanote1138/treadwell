Simple tank robot with ESP8266 and WebSockets :)

## Introduction

I had an old [SRV-1 Surveyor Robot](http://www.robotcombat.com/products/IL-SRV1Q.html) laying around and decided I wanted to update it with more modern tech. The aluminum chassis, motors, tank treads, and 7.5v lipo were all in great shape and ripe for reuse. I opted for the Wemos D1 Mini as the base as they're low-power, resilient, and easy to use.
